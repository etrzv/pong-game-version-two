This classic Pong game has been made with the help of @TokyoEdTech's tutorial. 

Two versions of the game are uploaded. The first one is the version from the tutorial with all the comments regarding
the code, and it's functionality. The second version of the game is a personal rendition with updated 
file structure and OOP, and other added functions. 

There are inaccuracies with the scoreboard visualization, that's why those lines of code have been commented.
